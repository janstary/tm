The mult.tm machine only multiplies by zero.
Employ the copy machine to do non-zero products.

Run more than one machine with 'tm M1.tm M2.tm':
after M1 halts, start M1 on the current tape.

Allow ' ' on tape?

tm -c (concatenate machines)
	with tm -c M1 M2, instead of running the two machines,
	print an instruction set of the "compound" machine

tm -C (conditionals)
	with tm -C M1 M2 M3, instead of running the machines,
	print the instructions set of if M1 then M2 else M3

tm -p (projection)
	generate the projection machine (pi_i^k)

tm -n (numbers)
	produce the number tape, as in tm -n 3,2 => 0111101110

tm -N (numbers)
	interpret the number tape, as in 0111101110 => 3 2

tm -r (resources)
	after halting (or upon receiving SIGINFO)
	report the number of steps taken and memory (tape) used
