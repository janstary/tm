.Nm bb
.Nd run the busy beaver competition
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl s Ar steps
.Ar num
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
generates the Turing machines having
.Ar num
states and runs them on an empty tape,
reporting the machine that said the biggest number.
.Pp
The
.Fl s
option puts an artificial upper bound
on the number of steps each machine can take
before it is deemed non-halting and ruled out.
There is no such upper bound of course,
as the number of steps a machine with
.Ar num
states could take grows faster than any computable function.
