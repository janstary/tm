.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b Ar blank
.Op Fl qtT
.Ar machine
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs the Turing machine described in a
.Ar machine
file consisting of lines in the form
.Ic srwmt ,
where
.Ic s
and
.Ic t
are machine states,
.Ic r
and
.Ic w
are tape symbols, and
.Ic m
is a move
.Po
.Sq L
for left,
.Sq R
for rigt
.Pc .
The tape symbols and state names must be chars recognized by
.Xr isalnum 3 .
Every line describes an instruction:
in a state
.Ic s ,
if you read
.Ic r
on the tape, write
.Ic w
to the tape,
move left or right as per
.Ic m ,
and change your state to
.Ic t .
Initially, the machine is in the
.Ic s
state of the first instruction.
The machine is required to be deterministic,
i.e. there can only be one instruction for every
.Ic sr
combination.
The machine halts if there is no instruction for the current
.Ic s
state and
.Ic r
input.
.Pp
The machine operates on a tape described by a line of stdin.
The line may only contain alphanumeric characters.
By default,
.Sq 0
is considered the blank symbol.
The machine head initially points to the first
non-blank symbol on the tape, if any.
Otherwise, the head points to the first symbol.
If and when the machine halts,
.Nm
prints the eventual content of the tape
(which means computations can be easily piped).
.Pp
If there are more input lines (tapes),
another computation starts as above,
until the input is exhausted.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxx -compact
.It Fl b Ar X
Let the blank symbol be
.Sq X
instead of the default
.Sq 0 .
.It Fl q
Do not print the content of the tape upon halting.
.It Fl t
Display the tape before every step of the machine.
.It Fl T
Like
.Fl t ,
with the head position and state indicated.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following machine computes the successor function
when using the tally notation to represent natural numbers on tape:

.Dl A11RA
.Dl A01LB
.Dl B11LB
.Dl B00RH
