.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b Ar blank
.Op Fl qtT
.Ar machine
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
runs the Turing machine described in a
.Ar machine
file consisting of lines in the form
.Ic srwmt ,
where
.Ic s
and
.Ic t
are machine states,
.Ic r
and
.Ic w
are tape symbols, and
.Ic m
is a move
.Po
.Sq L
for left,
.Sq R
for right,
.Sq N
for nothing
.Pc .
The tape symbols and state names must be alphanumeric characters.
Every line describes an instruction:
in a state
.Ic s ,
if you read
.Ic r
on the tape, write
.Ic w
to the tape,
move left or right as per
.Ic m ,
and change your state to
.Ic t .
Initially, the machine is in the
.Ic s
state of the first instruction.
The machine is required to be deterministic,
i.e. there can only be one instruction for every
.Ic sr
combination.
The machine halts if there is no instruction for the current
.Ic s
state and
.Ic r
input.
.Pp
The initial tape content is given by a line of standard input.
The line may only contain alphanumeric characters.
By default,
.Sq 0
is considered the blank symbol.
The machine head is initially positioned at
the last non-blank symbol on the tape, if any.
Otherwise, the head is positioned in the middle of the tape.
If and when the machine halts,
.Nm
prints the eventual content of the tape
(so computations can be easily piped).
.Pp
If there are more input lines (tapes),
another computation of the same machine starts,
until the input is exhausted.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxx -compact
.It Fl b Ar X
Consider
.Sq X
to be the blank symbol instead of the default
.Sq 0 .
.It Fl q
Do not print the content of the tape upon halting.
.It Fl t
Display the tape before every step of the machine.
.It Fl T
Like
.Fl t ,
with the head position and state indicated.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following machine is the winner of the Busy Beaver competiton
for machines with two active states.
